# Breakfast Restaurant Location Optimization
## Introduction
Calgary is home to a vibrant culinary scene, and breakfast restaurants are no exception. However, while some areas (such as 17th ave) are nearly saturated in gourmet breakfast establishments, others are nearly devoid of anything other than fast food chains. If an up-and-coming Calgarian chef wanted to establish their very own breakfast joint, which communities would be most suitable? In other words, which communities in Calgary have the highest unmet demand for breakfast? 
## Data
[Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) will be used to gather data on the current selection of breakfast restaurants in Calgary. Demographic data on Calgarians and their communities will be gathered from [Open Calgary](https://data.calgary.ca/) datasets such as the [2018 Census](https://data.calgary.ca/Demographics/Census-by-Community-2018/cc4n-ndvs).

Here's a chart that has nothing to do with this. I'm just testing if github.io supports Plotly plots...
